    "    * **minimum**—the smallest value in a collection of values.\n",
    "    * **maximum**—the largest value in a collection of values.\n",
    "    * **range**—the range of values from the minimum to the maximum.\n",
    "    * **count**—the number of values in a collection.\n",
    "    * **sum**—the total of the values in a collection."
