"""
3.8 (Arithmetic, Smallest and Largest) In Exercise 2.10, you wrote a script that input three integers, then displayed the sum, average, product, 
smallest and largest of those values. 
Reimplement your script with a loop that inputs four integers.

Read #3.8. However, instead of asking the user to input 4 integers, let them input as many as they wish.  Use the letter "z" as a sentinel, meaning, when they enter the letter "z", we know they are done inputting integers.

Name your file DescriptiveStatsManyInts_YourName.py.

Of course, points will be taken off if the usual conventions are not followed.
